tiddlywebplugins.static is a simple plugin for TiddlyWeb to deliver
static content read from disk. This is only useful if the web server you
are using does not include it's own system for delivering static
content. If it does, for example if you are using Apache or nginx, then
have that web server deliver static content. It will be much more
efficient.

See the code documentation for installation and configuration
information.
