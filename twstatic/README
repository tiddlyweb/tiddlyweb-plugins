tiddlyweb.static is a simple plugin for TiddlyWeb to deliver static
content read from disk. This is only useful if the web server you are
using does not include it's own system for delivering static content. If
it does, for example if you are using Apache, then have that web server
deliver static content. It will be much more efficient.

See the code documentation for installation and configuration
information.
