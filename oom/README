This is a TiddlyWeb plugin which extends the TiddlyWeb filter syntax 
to add 'oom' (One Of Many) which matches if the named attribute is any
of those named in the provided list. It is similar to
tiddlywebplugins.mselect but only matches the named attribute against
many names, not many possible attributes.

This will return all tiddlers with tag blog or published (or both) and
then sort by modified:

    oom=tag:blog,published;sort=-modified
