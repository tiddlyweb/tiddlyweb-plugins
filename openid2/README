This is an OpenID challenger for TiddlyWeb that replaces
the one included in the core TiddlyWeb package. It improves
on that one by using the python-openid package, thus supporting
OpenID 2 and improved discovery mechanisms.

To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.openid2' to auth_systems via 
tiddlywebconfig.py. The following example replaces all existing
auth_systems with just openid.

config = {
    'auth_systems': ['tiddlywebplugins.openid2'],
}

This package is licensed under the same terms at TiddlyWeb itself.
