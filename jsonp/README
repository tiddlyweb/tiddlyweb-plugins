tiddlywebplugins.jsonp is a subclass of the JSON serializer
which optionally allows the JSON output from TiddlyWeb to be
packaged as JSONP (JSON with padding). This is a method for
getting around cross domain constraints. You should only use
this if you know what you are doing with regard to security
issues.

To use, add 'jsonp' to system_plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py.

When requests are made for JSON if there is a jsonp_callback
query parameter the value of that parameter will be prepended
to the output, with the required '(' and ')'.
